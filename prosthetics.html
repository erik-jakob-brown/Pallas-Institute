			<p>This model is also intended for above the knee replacements.  The artificial knee can detect when to bend and is highly responsive, although it is intender for slower speeds.  This model is very durable, the attachment pictured here can support both walking and slower running speeds, and can also be swapped with an attachment that supports a shoe.</p>
